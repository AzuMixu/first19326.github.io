00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.070
You can't connect the dots looking forward

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.200
you can only connect them looking backwards

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.520
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.130
You have to trust in something

5
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.750
your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.070
Because believing that the dots will connect down the road

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.290
will give you the confidence to follow your heart

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.530
even when it leads you off the well worn path

9
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.120
And that will make all the difference

10
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.270
Your time is limited

11
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.220
so don't waste it living someone else's life

12
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.180
Don't be trapped by dogma

13
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.230
which is living with the results of other people's thinking

14
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.380
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice

15
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.360
You've got to find what you love

16
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.430
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.

17
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.080
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life

18
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.070
and the only way to be truly satisfied

19
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.160
is to do what you believe is great work

20
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.260
And the only way to do great work

21
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.040
is to love what you do

22
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.019
If you haven't found it yet

23
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.239
keep looking

24
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.230
and don't settle

25
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.100
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition

26
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.160
they somehow already know

27
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.360
what you truly want to become

28
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.040
You gonna have some ups and you gonna have some downs

29
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.110
Most people give up on themselves easily

30
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.100
You know the human spirit is powerful

31
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.140
There is nothing as powerful. It's hard to kill the human spirit

32
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.360
Anybody can feel good when they have their health, their bills are paid, they have happy relationships

33
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.250
Anybody can be positive then

34
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.700
anybody can have a larger vision then

35
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.030
anybody can have faith under those kinds of circumstances.

36
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.780
The real challenge of growth mentally, emotionally and spiritually 

37
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.910
comes when you get knocked down

38
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.720
It takes courage to act

39
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.320
part of being hungry when you have been defeated

40
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.020
It takes courage

41
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.020
to start over again

42
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.150
Fear kills dreams

43
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.550
Fear kills hope

44
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.670
Fear

45
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.250
put people in the hospital

46
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.510
Fear can age you

47
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.240
can hold you back from doing something that you know within yourself that you are capable of doing

48
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:43.220
but it will paralyze you

49
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.000
At the end of your feelings is nothing

50
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.070
but at the end of every principle is a promise

51
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.130
Behind your little feelings, it might not be absolutely nothing at the end of your little feelings

52
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.580
but behind every principle is a promise

53
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.080
And some of you in your life

54
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.100
the reason why you not at your goal right now, because you just all about your feelings

55
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.260
All of your feelings, you don't feel like waking up, so who does

56
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.030
Everyday you say 'no' to your dreams

57
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.150
you might be pushing your dreams back a whole six months, a whole year

58
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.260
That one single day, that one day you didn't get up could have pushed your stuff back, I don't know how long

59
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.090
Don't allow your emotions to control you

60
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.040
We are emotional, but what you want to begin to discipline your emotion

61
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.010
If you don't discipline and contain your emotion, they will use you

62
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.980
You want it

63
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.110
and you're going to go all out to have it

64
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.090
It's not going to be easy, when you want to change, it's not easy

65
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.250
If it were in fact easy, everybody would do it

66
00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:01.100
But if you're serious, you'll go all out

67
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.150
I'm in control here

68
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.180
I'm not going to let this get me down, I'm not going to let this destroy me

69
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.240
I'm coming back

70
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.270
And I'll be stronger and better because of it

71
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.850
You have got to make a declaration

72
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.160
that this is what you stand for

73
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.160
You're standing up for your dreams

74
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.579
you're standing up for peace of mind

75
00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.040
you're standing up for health

76
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.170
take full responsibility for your life

77
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:34.230
Accept where you are and the responsibility that you're going to take yourself where you want to go

78
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.170
You can decide that I'm going to live each day as if it were my last

79
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.110
Live your life with passion

80
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.100
With some drive

81
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.070
Decided that you are going to push yourself

82
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.130
The last chapter to your life has not been written yet

83
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.080
and it doesn't matter about what happened yesterday

84
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.240
It doesn't matter about what happened to you, what matters is

85
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.240
'what are you going to do about it?'

86
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.010
This year I will make this goal become a reality

87
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.180
I won't talk about it anymore

88
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.050
I can

89
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.020
I can

90
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.240
I can

91
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.520
To persevere I think is important for everybody

92
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.020
Don't give up, don't give in

93
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.240
There's always an answer to everything
